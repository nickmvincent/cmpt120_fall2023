Here, we have another practice assignment to dive deeper on many ways we can define functions. Try to solve this challenge below, then check out the solution:

In this exercise, you are required to write a series of functions in Python to demonstrate your understanding of arguments, return values, and general function design. Here are the tasks:

1. No Argument, No Return: Write a function `greet()` that prints "Hello, World!" when called.

2. Single Argument, No Return: Write a function `display(value)` that prints the value passed to it when called.

3. Multiple Arguments, No Return: Write a function `show_sum(a, b)` that prints the sum of a and b when called.

4. No Argument, With Return: Write a function `get_pi()` that returns the value of Ï€ (3.14159).

5. Single Argument, With Return: Write a function `square(x)` that returns the square of x.

6. Multiple Arguments, With Return: Write a function `find_max(a, b, c)` that returns the maximum value among a, b, and c.

7. Default Arguments: Write a function `power(base, exponent=2)` that returns the result of raising base to the power of exponent. The exponent should default to 2 if not provided.

8. Variable Number of Arguments: Write a function `calculate_mean(*args)` that returns the mean of all the numbers passed to it.

9. Keyword Arguments: Write a function `create_profile(name, **kwargs)` that prints the name and any additional keyword arguments passed to it.
