# CMPT 120
In this repo, I'll share short example Python scripts
that I write for CMPT 120 lectures.


In `quarto_lecture_materials`, you can find the weekly lecture slides in a variety of formats.

In `summary_script_examples`, you can find a number of Python scripts that are heavily commented and try to explain a specific concept.

- string formatting
- string .strip()
- combinations of if, elif, and else
- nested for loops

If you want to review some of the code that appeared in any of the slides not included here (before Week 3 Wed), you can find that code in  `archived_content`.
