# Week 9 Interactive Materials (in lieu of Monday lecture slides)

In this folder, you'll find 4 folders containing "tldr"-level and "deepdive"-level activities that cover the Python `turtle` package and the use of functions in Python (note that that even the deepdive activities are relatively quick, but invite your exploration).

Recommended order:
- `turtle_tldr`
- `turtle_deepdive`
- `functions_tldr`
- `functions_deepdive`


Finally, "interactive.py" is a script I may use to play with some live examples.
