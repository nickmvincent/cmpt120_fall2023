# "Turtle TLDR"

This is meant to give a "Too long, didn't read" tutorial on Turtle. This will complement the other materials,
which will ask you to spend some time playing around with Turtle, and reading the docs (alongside me!)

If you've already done the online textbook reading, this will be mostly review.

If you can step through each line of code in this script, you'll be familiar with the 
functions listed in learning goals

you're recommend to use as follows: 
- glance through the check for understanding
- incrementally uncomment each line and re-run to see what's added or changed
- try changing the argument of each of the included functions
